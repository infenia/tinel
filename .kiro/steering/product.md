# Infenix

Infenix is a next-generation open-source platform designed to control, optimize, and analyze Linux-based systems using AI and LLMs. Developed by Infenia Private Limited, it interfaces with the Linux kernel through various system utilities and filesystem interfaces to gather detailed hardware data.

## Core Functionality

This MCP server exposes tools that allow querying detailed hardware information including:

- CPU information (model, cores, frequency, features)
- Memory information (RAM size, type, configuration)
- Storage information (disks, partitions, filesystem usage)
- PCI devices with detailed specifications
- USB devices and their hierarchy
- Network interfaces and hardware details
- Graphics hardware including GPU details

## Target Use Cases

- System diagnostics and troubleshooting
- Hardware inventory management
- System monitoring and reporting
- Integration with AI assistants for hardware-related queries
- Automated system analysis
