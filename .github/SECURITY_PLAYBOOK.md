# Security Incident Response Playbook

This playbook provides guidance for responding to security incidents detected by our automated security pipeline.

## 🚨 Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Response Time | Escalation |
|-------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| **Critical** | Active security breach, exposed secrets, RCE vulnerabilities | Immediate (< 1 hour) | Security team + Management |
| **High** | Serious vulnerabilities, dependency issues with known exploits | 4 hours | Security team |
| **Medium** | Configuration issues, outdated dependencies | 24 hours | Development team |
| **Low** | Best practice violations, informational findings | 1 week | Development team |

## 🔍 Incident Response Procedures

### 1. Immediate Response (Critical/High)

#### Step 1: Assess the Situation
- [ ] Review security scan results and artifacts
- [ ] Determine scope of potential impact
- [ ] Check if vulnerability is already being exploited
- [ ] Document initial findings

#### Step 2: Containment
- [ ] Disable affected systems if necessary
- [ ] Rotate compromised secrets/credentials
- [ ] Block malicious IP addresses if applicable
- [ ] Preserve evidence for investigation

#### Step 3: Communication
- [ ] Notify security team via priority channel
- [ ] Create incident tracking issue (use template below)
- [ ] Update stakeholders on status
- [ ] Prepare external communication if needed

### 2. Investigation & Analysis

#### Evidence Collection
```bash
# Download security artifacts
gh run download <run-id> --pattern "*security*"

# Review vulnerability reports
cat vulnerability-reports/safety-report.json | jq .
cat vulnerability-reports/pip-audit-report.json | jq .
cat static-analysis/bandit-report.json | jq .
```

#### Analysis Checklist
- [ ] Identify root cause
- [ ] Determine attack vectors
- [ ] Assess data exposure risk
- [ ] Check for lateral movement
- [ ] Review system logs
- [ ] Validate security controls

### 3. Remediation

#### Vulnerability Patching
```bash
# Update vulnerable dependencies
uv pip install --upgrade <package-name>

# Run security validation
uv run safety check
uv run bandit -r tinel
```

#### Secret Rotation Process
1. **Identify Exposed Secrets**
   - API keys, tokens, passwords
   - Database credentials
   - Signing keys

2. **Rotate Immediately**
   - Generate new credentials
   - Update applications/services
   - Revoke old credentials
   - Monitor for unauthorized usage

3. **Verification**
   - Re-run secret scanning
   - Test application functionality
   - Confirm old credentials are invalid

### 4. Recovery & Monitoring

#### Recovery Steps
- [ ] Deploy patched versions
- [ ] Verify fix effectiveness
- [ ] Restore normal operations
- [ ] Monitor for recurring issues
- [ ] Update security documentation

#### Enhanced Monitoring
```bash
# Increase security scan frequency temporarily
# Modify .github/workflows/security-enhanced.yml
# Change cron schedule to run every hour for 24h
- cron: '0 * * * *'  # Every hour (temporary)
```

## 🔧 Automated Response Actions

### GitHub Actions Integration

Our security workflows automatically:

1. **Create Issues** for critical findings
2. **Block Deployments** when vulnerabilities detected
3. **Notify Teams** via Slack/Teams integration
4. **Generate Reports** for compliance/audit

### Auto-Remediation Capabilities

```yaml
# Example auto-fix for dependency vulnerabilities
- name: Auto-fix vulnerabilities
  if: contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'auto-remediate')
  run: |
    # Update vulnerable packages
    uv pip install --upgrade $(echo "$VULN_PACKAGES" | tr ',' ' ')
    
    # Create PR with fixes
    git checkout -b security/auto-fix-${{ github.run_id }}
    git commit -am "security: auto-fix vulnerabilities"
    gh pr create --title "Security: Auto-fix vulnerabilities" \
                 --body "Automated vulnerability remediation"
```
