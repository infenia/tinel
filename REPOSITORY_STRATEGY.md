 GitHub Repository Maintenance Plan for tinel

  This document outlines the steps to configure and maintain your GitHub repository, ensuring consistency, quality, and security. Each step is designed to be performed via the GitHub web interface.

  1. Initial Repository Setup (If not already done)

  If your repository is new, ensure these foundational elements are in place. If it's an existing repository, verify their presence and content.

   * README.md: Provides an overview of the project.
       * Action: On your repository's main page, click "Add a README" or click the pencil icon to edit an existing one.
   * LICENSE: Specifies how your code can be used. Your repository already has a LICENSE file.
       * Action: On your repository's main page, click "Add license" or verify the existing LICENSE file.
   * `.gitignore`: Excludes specified files and directories from version control.
       * Action: On your repository's main page, click "Add .gitignore" or verify the existing .gitignore file.
   * `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`: Sets behavioral expectations for contributors. Your repository already has a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file.
       * Action: On your repository's main page, click "Add code of conduct" or verify the existing CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file.

  2. Branch Protection Rules

  Branch protection rules enforce workflows for one or more branches, such as requiring pull request reviews or passing status checks before merging. Your BRANCH_PROTECTION.md suggests rules for main and develop.

   * Access: Go to Settings > Branches.
   * Action: Click Add rule for each branch you want to protect (e.g., main, develop).

  For both main and develop branches, configure the following:

   1. Branch name pattern:
       * For the main branch: main
       * For the develop branch: develop
   2. Require a pull request before merging:
       * Check this box.
       * Required approvals: Set to 1 or 2 (as per BRANCH_PROTECTION.md recommendation).
       * Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed: Check this box.
       * Require review from Code Owners: Check this box (this works in conjunction with your CODEOWNERS file).
   3. Require status checks to pass before merging:
       * Check this box.
       * Require branches to be up to date before merging: Check this box.
       * Status checks to require: Select the status checks corresponding to your GitHub Actions workflows (e.g., ci from ci.yml). These will appear here after your CI workflow has run at least once.
   4. Require signed commits:
       * Check this box (as per BRANCH_PROTECTION.md recommendation).
   5. Do not allow bypassing the above settings:
       * Check this box to prevent administrators from bypassing the rules.

  3. Code Owners

  The CODEOWNERS file automatically requests reviews from designated individuals or teams when changes are made to code they own. Your repository already has a .github/CODEOWNERS file.

   * Action: Verify the content of .github/CODEOWNERS to ensure it accurately reflects the ownership of different parts of your codebase.
       * Example structure:

   1         # Default owners for everything in the repo
   2         *       @your-org/your-team
   3 
   4         # Specific owners for certain directories
   5         /tinel/cli/ @your-org/cli-team
   6         /tests/     @your-org/qa-team
   * Verification: When a pull request is opened that modifies files covered by CODEOWNERS, the designated owners should automatically be requested for review.

  4. GitHub Actions (CI/CD Workflows)

  Your repository has several GitHub Actions workflows in .github/workflows/. These automate tasks like continuous integration, dependency updates, and releases.

   * Access: Go to Actions tab on your repository.
   * Action:
       1. Enable Workflows: Ensure all workflows (e.g., ci.yml, dependency-update.yml, release.yml, etc.) are enabled. They usually are by default when pushed to the repository.
       2. Monitor Workflow Runs: Regularly check the Actions tab to ensure workflows are passing. If a workflow fails, investigate the logs provided by GitHub Actions to identify and fix the issue.
       3. Review Workflow Files: Periodically review the .github/workflows/*.yml files to ensure they are up-to-date with your project's needs and dependencies.

  5. Dependabot

  Your repository has a .github/dependabot.yml file, which configures Dependabot to automatically check for and update outdated dependencies.

   * Access: Go to Settings > Code security and analysis.
   * Action:
       1. Enable Dependabot alerts: Under "Dependabot alerts", click "Enable".
       2. Enable Dependabot security updates: Under "Dependabot security updates", click "Enable".
       3. Enable Dependabot version updates: Under "Dependabot version updates", click "Enable".
   * Verification: Dependabot will start creating pull requests for dependency updates based on your .github/dependabot.yml configuration. Monitor these PRs and merge them after appropriate review and testing.

  6. Security Policy

  Your repository has a SECURITY.md file, which provides instructions for reporting security vulnerabilities.

   * Access: Go to Security tab on your repository.
   * Action:
       1. Verify `SECURITY.md`: Ensure the SECURITY.md file is present and contains clear instructions for reporting vulnerabilities.
       2. Enable Security Advisories: Under the Security tab, click on Security advisories and then New draft security advisory to understand the process. This allows you to privately discuss and fix vulnerabilities before public disclosure.
       3. Enable Code Scanning (Optional but Recommended): If you plan to use tools like CodeQL (your .github/codeql/codeql-config.yml suggests this), configure it under Code security and analysis > Code scanning alerts.

  7. Contributing Guidelines

  Your CONTRIBUTING.md file provides guidelines for how others can contribute to your project.

   * Action:
       1. Review `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Ensure the CONTRIBUTING.md file is comprehensive and up-to-date. It should cover topics like:
           * How to set up the development environment.
           * Coding style guidelines.
           * How to submit bug reports and feature requests.
           * Pull request submission process.
       2. Link in README: Consider adding a link to CONTRIBUTING.md in your README.md for easy discoverability.

  8. Labels and Milestones (Best Practices)

  While not explicitly configured in your current files, using labels and milestones can significantly improve issue and pull request management.

   * Labels: Categorize issues and pull requests (e.g., bug, feature, enhancement, documentation, help wanted, good first issue).
       * Access: Go to Issues > Labels.
       * Action: Create, edit, or delete labels as needed.
   * Milestones: Group issues and pull requests into specific project goals or release cycles.
       * Access: Go to Issues > Milestones.
       * Action: Create new milestones with due dates and descriptions.

  9. Project Boards (Optional)

  GitHub Project boards (Kanban-style boards) can help visualize and track the progress of issues and pull requests.

   * Access: Go to Projects tab on your repository.
   * Action:
       1. Create a new project: Choose a template (e.g., "Basic Kanban") or start from scratch.
       2. Add issues/PRs: Link issues and pull requests to your project board and move them through different columns (e.g., "To do", "In progress", "Done").
