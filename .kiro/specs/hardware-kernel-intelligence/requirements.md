# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Infenix is a Linux hardware and kernel intelligence tool designed to provide comprehensive system analysis, optimization, and diagnostics capabilities. The tool will analyze system hardware through the Linux kernel interfaces, verify and optimize kernel configurations, parse system logs for insights, and leverage an AI-powered MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for intelligent diagnostics, recommendations, and interactive queries. This document outlines the requirements for the Infenix tool.

3. WHEN the MCP server is running THEN the system SHALL expose tools for log analysis.
4. WHEN the user makes a natural language query THEN the system SHALL interpret the query and execute the appropriate tools.
5. WHEN tools return results THEN the system SHALL provide human-readable explanations and insights.
6. WHEN the system detects issues THEN the system SHALL provide actionable recommendations.
7. IF the user asks follow-up questions THEN the system SHALL maintain context and provide relevant responses.

### Requirement 5: Command Line Interface

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a comprehensive command line interface, so that I can integrate the tool into my scripts and automation workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs the tool with appropriate arguments THEN the system SHALL execute the requested analysis.
2. WHEN the user requests help THEN the system SHALL display usage information and available commands.
3. WHEN the tool is executed THEN the system SHALL support various output formats (text, JSON, YAML).
4. WHEN the tool is executed with verbose flag THEN the system SHALL provide detailed output with explanations.
5. WHEN the tool is executed with quiet flag THEN the system SHALL provide minimal output suitable for scripting.
6. IF the tool encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and exit codes.

### Requirement 6: Performance and Resource Usage

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the tool to be efficient and lightweight, so that it doesn't impact system performance while analyzing it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool is running THEN the system SHALL use minimal CPU resources.
2. WHEN the tool is running THEN the system SHALL use minimal memory resources.
3. WHEN the tool is analyzing the system THEN the system SHALL not cause noticeable system slowdowns.
4. WHEN the tool is analyzing logs THEN the system SHALL handle large log files efficiently.
5. IF the system is under heavy load THEN the tool SHALL adjust its resource usage accordingly.

### Requirement 7: Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the tool to be secure and respect privacy, so that I can use it in production environments without concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool is running THEN the system SHALL not require unnecessary privileges.
2. WHEN the tool collects system information THEN the system SHALL not transmit data outside the local system without explicit consent.
3. WHEN the MCP server is running THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms.
